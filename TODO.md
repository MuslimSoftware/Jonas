# Todo List

- Implement auth on web which will block all paths unless authed (use landing.web.tsx that is currently implemented)
- Remove web index to make the root of web load everything with api
- Paginate messages and only get latest X amount of messages, make sure order is proper
- Refactor ChatContext to be more modular and use useApi hook for state managements
